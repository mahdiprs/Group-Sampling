Journal: Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics (Pending Acceptance)

Short Description: This project, currently under review for the Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics, develops and applies beta-binomial models for group testing in biosecurity operations, accounting for between-consignment variability and possible clustering within groups. The models are used to assess the distribution of contaminated units in consignments of agricultural products, such as seeds, and aim to provide new insights for biosecurity regulation. The repository contains the code for calculating model parameters, sensitivity analysis, and estimating the probability of a consignment containing contamination and evading detection. Additionally, a Shiny app is included for interactive exploration of system dynamics and visualization of the model outcomes.
